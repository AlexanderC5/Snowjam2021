[EXPRESSION]1
It's a pretty day. Beautiful even. Birds are singing. Flowers are blooming. Christmas lights are glowing. On any other day, I'd be content. Smiling even.

But that's impossible. After all, it's almost Christmas dinner, and two dunces who haven't the slightest idea how to cook are in charge of feeding two entire families.

I'm one of them.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]2
STUAAART, WHERE DID YOU PUT THE MEASURING CUPS?

[THOUGHT]
She's the other.

[Stuart]
I don't know, you were the last one using them.

[Toa]
I was?

[THOUGHT]
She pauses. I can almost hear the clockwork gears grinding inside that head of hers.

[Toa]
I was!

[THOUGHT]
She hops on her feet and trots over to the stovetop, where I see the measuring cups scattered haphazardly.

She hums a happy christmas tune to herself as she scoops up the cups and scrambles off in another direction.

That's LI, my best friend for what feels like forever. Our families have been incredibly tight knit, even before we were born.

I honestly can't recall a memory where she wasn't there by my side. Every gathering, every vacation, every holidy, we'd spend together.

In a way, she's almost like a sister to me.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]2
AGH-

[THOUGHT]
A clumsy one at that.

[Stuart]
Toa? Are you okay?

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]3
I'm alright! Just tripped over the rug~

[THOUGHT]
She pops up and dusts herself off, ready to zoom back to work.

[Stuart]
Jeez, be more careful. I don't wanna have to watch these cooking tutorials and you at the same time.

[Toa]
I'm fine, don't worry about me! Are <i>you</i> okay?

[THOUGHT]
Am I? God, I've been so wound up this entire day. How are we supposed to cook dinner for two whole families by tonight?

The clock's ticking until our parents come back from last minute Christmas shopping.

[Stuart]
I'm alive and my heart's still beating. I'll survive. Thank's for asking.

[Toa]
Always!

[THOUGHT]
She pauses and leans in, studying my face for a few seconds.
She's... quite close.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]1
Hey, I know you're worried abou tonight. I am too... but try and keep your chin up, okay? I promise it'll be okay!

[THOUGHT]
She beams a sheepish smile at me. Maybe the reason she keeps tripping is because the weight of her golden heart keeps pulling her down.

Oh my god, what's wrong with me. That sounded like a line out of a low-budget hallmark movie. I'm really losing it, aren't I?

But, I can't help but notice again how close she is. I'm not opposed to it.
On the contrary, actually...

Christ. Snap out of it, MC. You have potatoes to mash.

[Stuart]
Yeah, you're right.

[THOUGHT]
No use in standing around. The first in the itinerary is mashed potatoes. A classic. Hard to screw up unless you mash your finger, in which case you'd probably have bigger things to worry about.

I grab the pot near me and start filling it with water to boil. I put it down on the stove and watch as the blue flames lick the bottom of the pot.

[Stuart]
Alright Toa, let's get down to business.

[Toa]
To defeat the Huns?

[Stuart]
Oh, shush.

[THOUGHT]
We giggle. Maybe we really can pull this off.
