[THOUGHT]
It's a pretty day. Beautiful even. Birds are singing. Flowers are
blooming. Christmas lights are glowing. On any other day, I'd be
content. Smiling even.

But that's impossible. After all, it's almost Christmas dinner, and
two dunces who haven't the slightest idea how to cook are in charge
of feeding two entire families.

I'm one of them.

MCCCC, where did you put the measuring cups?

[THOUGHT]
She's the other.

[MC]
I don't know, you were the last one using them.

[LI]
I was?

[THOUGHT]
She hops on her feet and trots over to the stovetop, where I see the
measuring cups scattered haphazardly. She hums a happy christmas tune
to herself as she scoops up the cups and scrambles off in another
direction.
