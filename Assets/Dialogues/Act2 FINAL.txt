After a moment of some hard work and good elbow grease, we finally finish the mashed potatoes.

Viola, as the French would say. Not bad for two people following an online tutorial.

I almost flop down on the couch to take a break. Then I remember that this is just the appetizer and we still have to make countless other dishes.

God, I hate everything.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]19
Hey, you hanging in there?
[EXPRESSION]16

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
[Stuart]
More or less. Probably less.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]14
I'd say we're making good progress! What's next on the list?
[EXPRESSION]12


[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
Let's see... well, we've got Pigs in Blankets, Puff Pastries, the Charcuterie Board...

[THOUGHT]
I continue to list off the unending list of dishes. It's longer than a line at the DMV.

Out of the corner of my eye, I see a bead of sweat run down Toa's face.

[Stuart]

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]3
Ah... well, at least we got one of them down.

[THOUGHT]
She readjusts her apron and rolls up her sleeves, ready to hop back into the fight.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]3
The food's not going to cook itself, right?
[EXPRESSION]0

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
Right.
[EXPRESSION]0

[THOUGHT]
Washing our hands and prepping the kitchen, we set off on our long culinary journey.

Heeding the instructions of a short-tempered Brit yelling through the screen of our laptop, we find ourselves in a work trance.

The sound of knives chopping and the stove pan sizzling rang, as the scent of butter and spices wafted through the Christmas air.

We work in near silence, only speaking to pass instruments or ingredients to one another.

Slowly but surely, we were knocking out the recipes. The dinner table began to swell with trays and food as the minutes flew by.

Sometimes in our work grind, I notice that Toa has stopped. I turn to find her stealing a glance at me.

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]11
Hm? Is there something on my face?
[EXPRESSION]8

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]3
Nope.
[EXPRESSION]13

[THOUGHT]
She smiles and gets back to her work. Strange, she's been doing that a lot recently. Maybe she's tired?

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]2
Is there something on <i>my</i> face?
[EXPRESSION]1

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]1
[THOUGHT]
Crap. Now I was the one staring.

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
...nope.
[EXPRESSION]0

[THOUGHT]
And with that, we turn back to our cutting boards.

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
Y'know, we'd probably have been done by now if our parents helped us with cooking all this.
[EXPRESSION]0

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]7
Well, it's not all bad. It just means we're spending more time together.
[EXPRESSION]4

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]3
Don't we already spend nearly every living moment together?
[EXPRESSION]0

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]3
School and classes don't count! We're surreounded by other people there. It's not like that's a bad thing, but it's nice to just relax with someone you really care about...
[EXPRESSION]0

[THOUGHT]
She pauses, seemingly startled by her own words.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]14
S-sorry, I didn't mean it like...
[EXPRESSION]13

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]14
It's alright. It means a lot.
[EXPRESSION]13


[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]18
Ah... I'm glad.

[EXPRESSION]17
[THOUGHT]
As she turns back to her dish-in-progress, I see her face turn almost a bright red. There's a palpable awkwardness in the air.

I'm not sure why she'd be so embarrased by that. Toa's always an open book, and there's no doubt that we care for each other deeply.

Then the thought occurs to me.

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]13

[THOUGHT]
Does she...

...

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]0

[THOUGHT]
Christ, stop getting your hopes up. Just cook the damn food.

[Stuart]
[EXPRESSION]15
...so, what's next on the list?

[EXPRESSION]12

[THOUGHT]
She looks relieved that the mood's been changed. She springs back up to normal with almost a child-like energy.

[Toa]
[EXPRESSION]15
Gingerbread cookies!

[EXPRESSION]13

[THOUGHT]
Gingerbread cookies it is.
